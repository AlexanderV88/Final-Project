        <p style="color: #ffffff; font-size: large;">Well... I'm not typically a mobile gamer, but a couple of months
        ago I was looking for something to play on my phone that was anime themed, after having an anime binge watching week.<br><br>
        So I went to Google in search of anime like mobile games, and came across Epic Seven.<br><br>
        Needless to say, I have been hooked on it since then. I really like the animated special attacks that the characters
        have. They have a big anime feel to them.<br><br>
        And honestly, I was having a hard time thinking of what to do for a final project. I was going through so many ideas
        in my head, and while I was making mock-ups of the layout, I kept using Epic Seven pictures as place holders. 
        Then I just decided to make an Epic Seven fan page.<br><br>
        I hope you enjoy the skill showcase YouTube video!</p>
